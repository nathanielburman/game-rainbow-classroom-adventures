Abstract:
Rainbow Classroom Adventures is an educational game that aims to promote acceptance, understanding, and inclusivity among young children. Players assume the role of a compassionate kindergarten school teacher who guides their students through engaging conversations about gender affirming care, gender ideology, and LGBTQ+ affirmations. The game begins with the children having limited knowledge about LGBTQ+ topics, but through a series of one-on-one interactions, they gradually develop an understanding and acceptance of diverse identities and expressions.
Each conversation in the game follows a format where the teacher speaks one sentence, and the child responds with another sentence. As the game progresses, the children encounter various scenarios and questions that challenge common misconceptions and stereotypes. Through thoughtful and age-appropriate dialogue, the teacher helps the children recognize the importance of empathy, respect, and embracing individuality. By the end of the game, the children have gained a deeper appreciation for LGBTQ+ individuals, fostering a positive and inclusive environment within the classroom.
Rainbow Classroom Adventures provides an interactive and accessible platform for children to learn about LGBTQ+ topics in a supportive and engaging manner. By promoting acceptance from an early age, the game aims to create a foundation of inclusivity that can extend beyond the virtual world, fostering a more tolerant and understanding society.

The Simplicity of the Actual Game:
You play as a teacher and you interact with a student. There is only one progression for each student interaction. Our satire will immediately become known as each student becomes gay.

Have a gay flag floating above the head of any gay child.

The game is over after the player talks to the last child.

Each child that turns gay could give the player a gay pride reward that can customize the classroom.

That is the full extent of this game.
